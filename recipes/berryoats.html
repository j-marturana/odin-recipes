        <h3>Description</h3>
        This is a recipe for overnight oats with berries. My roommate sometimes makes overnight oats when he's trying to be fancy. To be honest, I prefer fresh oats, but the overnight variety <i>do</i> seem easier.

            <li>1 teaspoon chia seeds (Optional)</li>
            <li>1 cup fresh mixed berries and fruit </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Add Quaker® Oats to your container of choice and pour in milk.</li>
            <li>Layer Greek yogurt, chia seeds and mixed fruit and berries.</li>
